Hi Sijie,


Yes, It is believed to be possible for life, or evidence of life, on a meteor to survive an impact. Although we don't have any direct evidence, since that would mean we had discovered concrete evidence of extra terrestrial life, there are extremophiles which are robust enough to survive the radiation (radioresistant) and vacuum of space (anaerobes) and the heat (thermophiles) and pressure (piezophiles) of an impact [1]. From my research it seems that Tardigrades are an example of microorganisms that might be capable of all this [2]. However, that depends on the length of time spent exposed to each environment.


Some types of evidence of life, such as fossil remnants, are also believed to be able to survive, in fact, NASA even thought they'd found such evidence in 1996 from studying the ALH 84001 meteorite [3]. Suspected microfossils could be seen when examining the meteorite under a microscope. However, today it is generally believed that it is not actually concrete evidence of life, since if the structures were actually fossils they would be too small for the chemical machinery needed for life to take place, and it's possible the meteor was contaminated after it collided with Earth [4].


Your second question refers to the theory that life on Earth (or on other planets) originated elsewhere in the universe and was transported on a meteor. This is known as panspermia[5]. Interestingly, from researching your question, I found there are actually a few variants of panspermia. The version that I knew about, called lithopanspermia, theorises that microscopic life, such as bacteria or similar, exists on a planet somewhere. Then due to a large enough impact, parts of the planet's crust are flung into space. These fragments, colonised by extremophiles then drift through space for years, or perhaps millennia, until at least one fragment is then captured by the gravity of another planet, or even star system, and collides with a planet. Although it's nearly impossible to prove without direct evidence, scientists believe all the constituents exist for it to happen.


Variants on this theory include:

  - Radiopanspermia, in which microscopic life is transported via radiation pressure from the star.

  - Accidental panspermia, in which garbage dumped by sentient aleins evolves into complex life (like humans)

  - Direct panspermia, in which aliens intentionally place microorganisms on a planet to foster evolution

  - Pseudo-panspermia, in which the first life forms were created in the solar nebula as the planets formed, and then fell to the surface.


Obviously, the last few are just theories, and cannot currently be proven rigorously. However radiopanspermia is currently believed to be infeasible, since radiation pressure required is not strong enough to move rocks the size required for life.
